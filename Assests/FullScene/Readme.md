# README
This asset contains all 3 games in one scene
To use just start a new unity project and import this asset.
It should have the SteaVR asset bundled in but, if for some odd reason it doesn't work try downlaod steamVR asset from the asset store

Also it's too big for github so I uploaded it to the drive
 check in the senior project drive its under Assets Fullscene
