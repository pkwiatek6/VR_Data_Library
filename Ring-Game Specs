Summary:
  The objective of the ring game is to test physical dexterity by measuring the players ability to manipulate a ring along a pre-defined
  path, much like the carnival game of the same name.

Parameters
  - Speed at which the ring is moved along the wire path
    - While this is an important metric, it is important that it not be used in any sort of "overall score" calculations, as the score could
    produce outlier results if the ring is just rushed to the end point without traveling along the wire at all. It may be possible to 
    implement some sort of anti-cheat method to prevent this
  - Accuracy
    - How close the centre of the wire is to the edges of the ring, averaged across the journey.
