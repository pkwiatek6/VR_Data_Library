MEMORY TEST
Parameters: Number of possible variations per step, Length of time shown to user, length of sequence 
           
            Number of possible variations per step:
                  - Suggest after every "round", variation number increases
                       - For instance, round one could have the steps be base 2 (each "number" could be 1 or 0), then round two would increase 
                         it to base-4 (with each "number" being represented by a color this time, in more traditional simon says), increasing
                         to base-10, and possibly even base-16 sequences
            
            Length of time shown to the user
                  - starting from the time the sequence is first presented to the user, their "score" would decrease until they hit a 
                    switch or button to turn the code off, and allow them to begin inputting. The purpose of this is to give the user as
                    much time as they need to memorize the sequence, while still providing an incentive to be as fast as they can.
                    
            Length of sequence
                  - Self explanitory - how long the sequence the user has to memorize is.
                  
                  
             
 To gather data from this, the time would need to be measured with how long it took them to begin entering the code, how long it took them
 to submit what they believed to be an accurate code, and the actual accuracy of the code itself.
